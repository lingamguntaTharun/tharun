Project Title: Smart Water System

Project Steps

Phase 1: Project Definition and Design Thinking

Project Definition: The project involves implementing IoT sensors to monitor water consumption in public places such as parks and gardens. The objective is to promote water conservation by making real-time water consumption data publicly available. This project includes defining objectives, designing the IoT sensor system, developing the data-sharing platform, and integrating them using IoT technology and Python.

Design Thinking:

Project Objectives: Define objectives such as real-time water consumption monitoring, public awareness, water conservation, and sustainable resource management.
IoT Sensor Design: Plan the design and deployment of IoT sensors to monitor water consumption in public places.
Real-Time Transit Information Platform: Design a mobile app interface that displays real-time parking availability to users.
Integration Approach: Determine how IoT sensors will send data to the data-sharing platform.
